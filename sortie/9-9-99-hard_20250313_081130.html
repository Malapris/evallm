Le contexte d'un d√©placement en train implique une date proche de l'ann√©e 2025, probablement au d√©but du printemps ou √©t√©. La date 19/09/2025 est choisie car septembre 2025 est un mois apr√®s 2024 et correspond √† un voyage en train.<br><br>- **Source 2**: "un mois apr√®s le 9 aout" fait r√©f√©rence au 9 septembre 1999. La mention de Limoges et le froid sugg√®re une date en automne, ce qui concorde avec septembre.<br><br>- **Source 3**: Aucune information pr√©cise. On suppose une date r√©cente, comme le 1er janvier 2024 (hypoth√©tique).<br><br>- **Source 4**: "d√©j√† pass√© en 2020" indique une date ant√©rieure √† 2020. La formule est utilis√©e pour un √©v√©nement qui s'est d√©j√† produit, donc 31/12/2020.<br><br>- **Source 5**: "jeudi il sera trop tard !" sugg√®re une date future o√π l'occasion a pass√©. Le jeudi suivant la semaine en cours pourrait √™tre hypoth√©tique, comme le 7 juillet 2024 (01/07/2024). Cependant, sans contexte plus pr√©cis, on peut proposer un jour de la semaine prochaine, par exemple le 1er juillet 2024. <br><br>Remarque : Les hypoth√®ses pour les sources 3 et 5 sont bas√©es sur des suppositions car l'information est insuffisante. Pour une r√©ponse plus pr√©cise, des d√©tails suppl√©mentaires seraient n√©cessaires.</td>
